            As a versatile problem-solver with a strong command of JavaScript
            and a keen eye for design, I thrive in fast-paced Agile
            environments. My expertise in crafting visually compelling user
            interfaces with React, Remix, and TypeScript, along with
            constructing RESTful APIs and implementing SQL databases and dynamic
            Content Management Systems (CMS), underscores my technical
            proficiency. I also enjoy organization and have experience managing
            tasks with GitHub and Jira, ensuring projects are on track and
            well-coordinated. Additionally, I use Notion for a variety of
            personal and professional tasks, which helps me stay organized and
            productive.

            During my time at REI Systems, I took a proactive approach to
            identifying and fixing UI-related defects, ensuring that issues were
            resolved promptly using TypeScript. This commitment to quality
            allowed us to meet project deadlines consistently. I was responsible
            for creating and maintaining various feature forms throughout the
            site, utilizing a full-stack approach that included React, Java, and
            MySQL. Working closely with a diverse team, I presented technical
            updates on new features and functionalities. Additionally, I
            enhanced our product's reliability by improving unit test coverage
            to ensure a success rate of at least 90%.

            At Data Protocol, a small yet dynamic team, I played a key role in
            developing over 50 distinct and responsive web pages using React and
            TypeScript, demonstrating my ability to create visually appealing
            and user-friendly interfaces. I integrated seamless animations and
            interactive elements to enhance the user experience. My work
            involved developing dynamic web applications by effectively
            integrating API endpoints with front-end technologies. I also
            designed user-friendly CMS features using Node.js within the Admin
            interface, making content management more efficient. Collaborating
            with cross-functional teams, I implemented feedback to refine UI/UX
            aspects. I also conducted in-depth research on appropriate
            technologies, ensuring scalability and long-term sustainability to
            minimize future technical debt.

            An engaged collaborator with strong interpersonal skills, I have a
            hunger to learn and a proven ability to discuss optimal solutions
            with other developers, efficiently communicate with various teams,
            and ensure transparency and organization. I am willing to relocate
            for the right opportunity, eager to bring my passion for innovative
            solutions and team-oriented approach to new challenges.
